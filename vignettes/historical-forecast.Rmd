## 1. TimeGPT Historical Forecast
When generating a forecast, sometimes you might be interested in forecasting the historical observations. These predictions, known as **fitted values**, can help you better understand and evaluate a model's performance over time. 

TimeGPT has a method for generating fitted values, and users can call it from `nixtlar`. This vignette will explain how to do this. It assumes you have already set up your TimeGPT token. If you haven't done this, please read the [Get Started](https://nixtla.github.io/nixtlar/articles/anomaly-detection.html) vignette first.  

## 2. Load data 
For this vignette, we'll use the electricity consumption dataset that is included in `nixtlar`, which contains the hourly prices of five different electricity markets. 

```{r}
df <- nixtlar::electricity
head(df)
```

## 3. Forecast historical data 
To generate a forecast for the historical data, use `nixtlar::timegpt_historic`. The key parameters of this method are: 

- **df**: The dataframe or tsibble with the time series data. It should include at least a column with the datestamps and a column with the observations. Default names for these columns are `ds` and `y`. If different, please specify their names. 
- **id_col**: If the data contains multiple ids, as in this case, please specify the column that contains them. If working with a single series, leave it as it is by default (NULL). 
- **level**: The prediction intervals for the forecast. 

```{r}
timegpt_fitted_values <- timegpt_historic(df, id_col = "unique_id", level = c(80,95))
head(timegpt_fitted_values)
```

Notice that there are no fitted values for some of the initial observations. This is because TimeGPT requires a minimum number of values to generate reliable forecasts. 

All the fitted values are generated using a rolling window, meaning that the fitted value for observation $T$ was generated using the first $T-1$ observations. 

### 3.1 Fitted values from `nixtlar::timegpt_forecast`
`nixtlar::timegpt_historic` is the dedicated function that calls TimeGPT's method for generating fitted values. However, you can also use `nixtlar::timegpt_forecast` with `add_history=TRUE`. This will generate both a forecast for the historical data and for the next $h$ future observations. 

## 4. Plot historical forecast 
`nixtlar` includes a function to plot the historical data and any output from `timegpt_forecast`, `timegpt_historic`, `timegpt_anomaly_detection` and `timegpt_cross_validation`. If you have long series, you can use `max_insample_length` to only plot the last N historical values (the forecast will always be plotted in full). 

```{r}
timegpt_plot(df, timegpt_fitted_values, id_col = "unique_id", max_insample_length = 200)
```
